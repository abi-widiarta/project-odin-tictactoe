# The Odin Project | Tic Tac Toe

The task is to used factory function, module or both

What I learn :
- Pre planning and brainstroming is very important
- Logic on using modal and pointer events none
- Factory function

Obstacles :
- Due to the minimum amount of pre-planning, a lot of problems occur while coding, and the script structure became very messy
- Messy script structure affect the readability of certain function which is hard to find
- Because of solving the problems directly while coding and due to a lot of problems that occured, at somepoint I forgot about what I just code and need to take time to understand it again

The script is still very messy and not clean coded, in the future I hope I can implement KIS and have a better script structure, because for this one is mostly my own solution from the problems that I created while coding.
